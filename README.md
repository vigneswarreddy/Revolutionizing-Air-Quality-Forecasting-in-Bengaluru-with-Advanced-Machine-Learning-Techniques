# Revolutionizing-Air-Quality-Forecasting-in-Bengaluru-with-Advanced-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Gathered air quality data from CPCB Website and converted it into AQI Values for model training. Implemented and trained machine learning models like regression, decision trees to predict AQI. Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² and deployed the best model for real-time AQI prediction.
